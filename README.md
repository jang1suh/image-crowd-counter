An automated analysis algorithm counts the number of people in an image.

No internet connection or login is required, and it's free without ads.


<p float="left">
    <img src="./img/preview_1.jpg" alt="preview_1" width="200" />
    <img src="./img/preview_2.jpg" alt="preview_2" width="200" />
    <img src="./img/preview_3.jpg" alt="preview_3" width="200" />
    <img src="./img/preview_4.jpg" alt="preview_4" width="200" />
</p>

It's hard to manually count how many people are in a scene.

This app automates that counting process.

It operates on-device, so no internet connection or login is needed.

- Optimized for overhead shots of crowds ranging from 10 to 500 people
- The app may not function properly on older models.
